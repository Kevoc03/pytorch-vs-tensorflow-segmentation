# PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Image Classification

This project compares two deep learning frameworks — **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** — on the Fashion MNIST dataset for image classification.  
We built and trained CNN models in both frameworks and compared their performance metrics such as **Dice Score** and **IoU**.
